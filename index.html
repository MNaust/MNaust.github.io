  <h1>Simple recipe for earwarmer</h1>
  
  

  <p>This is my first attempt at making a knitting recipe. It is really simple, but the wrong stitches makes a pattern that looks a bit different. Here is how you do it:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Cast on as many stitches as you like, depending on how wide you want the earwarmer to be, and the weight of your yarn.</li>
		<li>Round 1: knit all st.</li>
		<li>Round 2: purl all st.</li>
		<li>Round 3: knit all st.</li>
		<li>Round 4: knit all st. By knitting this round instead of purling, you will make the stripes on the front side.</li>
		<li>Knit round 1-4 repeatedly until desired length. Bind off and sew the two ends together.</li>
		
  </ol>
